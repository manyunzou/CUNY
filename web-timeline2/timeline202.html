            <p class="billSum">NYS bill S3737 and the concurrent A768 would add a new section 817 to the NYS Education Law to require the Commissioners of Health, Mental Health and Education to create and establish a comprehensive, medically accurate and age-appropriate sex education curriculum to be taught in grades 1-12 in all public and
charter schools.</p>
            <h4 class="billTitle">Importance for Ending the AIDS Epidemic</h4>
            <p class="billImportance">The ETE Blueprint supports educating New York State youth in
making healthy, positive choices about sexual health in order to avoid negative health outcomes such as HIV and STIs and unintended pregnancy (BP 23, Promote comprehensive sexual health education). This recommendation supports an expansion of comprehensive, age-appropriate, medically accurate health and sexuality education in 1-12 schools, which in turn would increase the number of young people receiving ageappropriate information about HIV and STI prevention tools, such as condoms, and nPEP and PrEP. This recommendation will also create a foundation of support for HIV testing by providing young people with information and messages that encourage and normalize HIV testing and prevention tools such as condoms, nPEP and PrEP. Mandating a basic curriculum for sexual health education is necessary to ensure that all youth are provided with the same essential public health information. A curriculum developed under the direction of these three State agencies will be inclusive of the full range of health and mental health issues currently affecting our youth, and the use of a uniform curriculum will facilitate implementation across the State.</p>

            <h4 class="billTitle">Importance for Ending the AIDS Epidemic</h4>
            <p class="billImportance">Data support the critical importance of access to HIV prevention and treatment for young people. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2014, 22% of new HIV infections were diagnosed among youth ages 13-24 years old. Most of these newly diagnosed infections occurred among young gay and bisexual males. Young black/African American and Hispanic/Latino gay and bisexual males are especially affected. Youth with HIV are the least likely out of any age group to be linked to care. Addressing HIV in youth requires that we give youth the tools they need to reduce their risk, make healthy decisions, get treatment and care if needed, and communicate effectively with others. In New York State, more than 30% of new HIV diagnoses in 2014 were among individuals under 24 years of age.  In New York City in 2015, 39% of persons newly diagnosed with HIV were under the age of 29, and persons living with HIV under the age of 24 had the lowest rate of viral load suppression of any group. </p>

            <p class="billSum">NYS bill S5062/A7061 would amend civil and criminal laws, rules and practices to prohibit use of the possession or presence on the premises of condoms and other sexual and reproductive health devices as evidence of any crime; and, further, repeal certain provisions of the criminal procedure law relating to condoms. </p>

            <h4 class="billTitle">Importance for Ending the AIDS Epidemic</h4>
            <p class="billImportance">As a part of the 2015-16 NYS budget, and in an attempt to curb the use of condoms as evidence for the majority of impacted New Yorkers, Governor Cuomo recommended, and the Legislature approved, language that would ban the use of condoms as evidence for two specific misdemeanor offenses: prostitution and loitering for the purposes of prostitution. The two crimes represented 90% of the arrests in which condoms had been used as evidence. This was a vital step, yet in practice condoms are still subject to confiscation and may be used as evidence of other crimes, both misdemeanor and felony. Condoms are a vital tool for New Yorkers to practice safer sex and protect themselves from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “a number of carefully conducted studies, employing rigorous methods and measures, have demonstrated that consistent condom use is highly effective in preventing HIV transmission.” Wide use of condoms should be promoted by all levels of government as a vital public health and HIV prevention method. The potential use of condoms as evidence of sex work or other crimes undermines the efforts of New York State and City public health authorities, health providers and nongovernmental organizations to promote safer sex and multilevel HIV prevention. The ETE Blueprint recommends removing disincentives related to possession of condoms (BP24 and “Getting to Zero” recommendation number 2) and clearly states that the practice of confiscating condoms and laws that permit a person’s possession of condoms to be offered as evidence continue to criminalize and stigmatize condom possession, which is in direct opposition to promotion of condom use as an HIV and STD prevention tool essential to public health. </p>

            <p class="billContent">Streamline and improve routine HIV-related testing, including for older adults, and improve screening for certain diseases and ability to prescribe Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP).</p>
            <h4 class="billTitle">Summary</h4>
            <p class="billSum">The legislation amends Public Health Law (PHL) § 2781 to remove provisions related to requiring informed consent from an individual prior to performing an HIV related test. The amendments would require that, at a minimum, the individual be advised that an HIV related test is going to being performed, and that any objection by the individual be noted in the individual's medical record. The legislation amends PHL § 2781-a(1) to eliminate the existing upper age limit for purposes of offering an HIV related test. Previous statute limited the mandatory offering to individuals between thirteen and sixty-four years of age. The legislation also amends Education Law to improve screening for certain diseases and ability to prescribe Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP).</p>

            <h4 class="billTitle">Importance for Ending the AIDS Epidemic</h4>
            <p class="billImportance">If not identified and treated early, HIV infection progresses and escalates to AIDS. Individuals who are infected but not on treatment are more likely to transmit the virus. Indeed, almost half of all new infections are thought to be from individuals who are unaware of their HIV status. In recognition of this fact, the first point of the Governor's three point plan is to identify persons with HIV who remain undiagnosed and to link them to care. Since 2010, New York State has required that health care providers offer HIV testing to all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 as a routine part of health care services. However, a 2015 review of hospital implementation of the requirement showed that too many New Yorkers are still not taking advantage of available testing. This bill takes steps to remove any barriers to individuals being able to voluntarily accept HIV testing by reducing administrative hurdles, and by educating individuals about their HIV status and options for accessing treatment.

            HIV testing must be made available to more New Yorkers. Half of all people living with diagnosed HIV infection in this State are age 50 and older, and approximately 200 cases of HIV are diagnosed each year in persons age 60 and older. This bill removes the upper age limit of 64 on the requirement of offering an HIV test, mandating that an HIV test be
            offered to all adults, regardless of age. There is no scientific basis justifying a 64 year age limit, and people over such age remain exposed to multiple risk factors. In addition, with the advent of new medications, persons over the age of 64 diagnosed with HIV are now able to live average life spans.  However, early diagnosis and access to treatment remain essential, and this legislation furthers that goal.

            STD rates are increasing in New York State. There are more than 100,000 cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in New York State, with rates of syphilis in particular having increased substantially. To address this problem, STD screening and sexual health care must become a routine health care service. This bill amends the New York State Education Law to allow registered nurses to screen persons at increased risk for syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, pursuant to a non-patient specific order. Expanding the existing nursing scope of practice to allow for registered nurses to screen persons at increased risk for these STDs will increase the number of people being diagnosed and treated, and will reduce the overall risks for HIV. This bill is consistent with the Ending the Epidemic Blueprint, which recognizes that sexually transmit-
            ted diseases put people at greater risk of HIV infection, and with U.S. Preventive Services (LISPS) recommendations.

            PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) is an HIV prevention method that only works if used within a short period of time after exposure to the virus. Specifically, PEP should be used within 72 hours of exposure, and is recommended within 36 hours of exposure - with optimal intake being within 2 hours. Currently, in order to obtain PEP, most patients must go to an emergency room. By enabling pharmacists to dispense a seven day starter kit of PEP pursuant to a non-patient specific order, this bill provides a cost-effective way of significantly increasing HIV prevention. Expanding access to PEP also strengthens consumer understanding and awareness, improves referral and coordination with doctors and other health professionals for follow-up to PEP, and increases individual assessment for other HIV prevention measures.</p>
