            <p class="billSum">S8129. A10724 (Governor's Program Bill #30)</p>
            <h4 class="billTitle">Summary</h4>
            <p class="billImportance">This legislation amends Public Health Law (PHL) § 2781 to streamline routine HIV testing. The amendments would require that, at a minimum, the individual be advised that an HIV related test is going to being performed, and that any objection by the individual be noted in the individual's medical record. The legislation also amends PHL to eliminate the existing upper age limit for purposes of offering an HIV related test. Previous statute limited the mandatory offering to individuals between thirteen and sixty-four years of age.</p>
            <h4 class="billTitle">Importance</h4>
            <p class="billImportance">If not identified and treated early, HIV infection progresses and escalates to AIDS. Individuals who are infected but not on treatment are more likely to transmit the virus. Indeed, almost half of all new infections are thought to be from individuals who are unaware of their HIV status. In recognition of this fact, the first point of the Governor's three point plan is to identify persons with HIV who remain undiagnosed and to link them to care. Since 2010, New York State has required that health care providers offer HIV testing to all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 as a routine part of health care services. However, a 2015 review of hospital implementation of the requirement showed that too many New Yorkers are still not taking advantage of available testing. This bill takes steps to remove any barriers to individuals being able to voluntarily accept HIV testing by reducing administrative hurdles, and by educating individuals about their HIV status and options for accessing treatment.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            HIV testing must be made available to more New Yorkers. Half of all people living with diagnosed HIV infection in this State are age 50 and older, and approximately 200 cases of HIV are diagnosed each year in persons age 60 and older. This bill removes the upper age limit of 64 on the requirement of offering an HIV test, mandating that an HIV test be offered to all adults, regardless of age. There is no scientific basis justifying a 64 year age limit, and people over such age remain exposed to multiple risk factors. In addition, with the advent of new medications, persons over the age of 64 diagnosed with HIV are now able to live average life spans. However, early diagnosis and access to treatment remain essential, and this legislation furthers that goal.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            STD rates are increasing in New York State. There are more than 100,000 cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia in New York State, with rates of syphilis in particular having increased substantially. To address this problem, STD screening and sexual health care must become a routine health care service. This bill amends the New York State Education Law to allow registered nurses to screen persons at increased risk for syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, pursuant to a non-patient specific order. Expanding the existing nursing scope of practice to allow for registered nurses to screen persons at increased risk for these STDs will increase the number of people being diagnosed and treated, and will reduce the overall risks for HIV. This bill is consistent with the Ending the Epidemic Blueprint, which recognizes that sexually transmit-ted diseases put people at greater risk of HIV infection, and with U.S. Preventive Services (LISPS) recommendations.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis) is an HIV prevention method that only works if used within a short period of time after exposure to the virus. Specifically, PEP should be used within 72 hours of exposure, and is recommended within 36 hours of exposure - with optimal intake being within 2 hours. Currently, in order to obtain PEP, most patients must go to an emergency room. By enabling pharmacists to dispense a seven day starter kit of PEP pursuant to a non-patient specific order, this bill provides a cost-effective way of significantly increasing HIV prevention. Expanding access to PEP also strengthens consumer understanding and awareness, improves referral and coordination with doctors and other health professionals for follow-up to PEP, and increases individual assessment for other HIV prevention measures.</p>

            <p class="billImportance">Data support the critical importance of access to HIV prevention and treatment for young people. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2014, 22% of new HIV infections were diagnosed among youth ages 13-24 years old. Most of these newly diagnosed infections occurred among young gay and bisexual males. Young black/African American and Hispanic/Latino gay and bisexual males are especially affected. Youth with HIV are the least likely out of any age group to be linked to care. Addressing HIV in youth requires that we give youth the tools they need to reduce their risk, make healthy decisions, get treatment and care if needed, and communicate effectively with others. In New York State, more than 30% of new HIV diagnoses in 2014 were among individuals under 24 years of age.  In New York City in 2015, 39% of persons newly diagnosed with HIV were under the age of 29, and persons living with HIV under the age of 24 had the lowest rate of viral load suppression of any group. </p>

            <h4 class="billTitle">Summary</h4>
            <p class="billSum">The New York State FY2018 Enacted Budget include legislation to expand the application of the New York State Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to include individuals age 24 and younger who need services and are without a place of shelter where supervision and care are available, an increase from the upper limit of 21. The new legislation also allows municipalities to significantly extend the length of stay in Runaway and Homeless Youth (RHY) crisis and transitional beds.</p>

            <h4 class="billTitle">Importance for Ending the AIDS Epidemic</h4>
            <p class="billImportance">Homeless youth are at high risk for HIV infection. Several factors place homeless youth at risk for HIV including survival sex (trading sex for basic needs), having multiple sexual partners, low frequency of condom use, and injection drug use. The early start of sexual activity and the large number of sexual partners also place some homeless youth at risk for HIV infection. In one study of New York City street youth, 21 percent of males and 24 percent of females reported having had more than 100 lifetime partners. </p>
