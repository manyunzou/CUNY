Peers reflect the diversity of the people they are serving, and they are uniquely qualified by their shared experiences to assist HIV-positive consumers to navigate various health care environments across the service continuum. Peers help to ensure that a consumer-centered approach is taken in service delivery and that access to culturally-and linguistically-appropriate interventions and health care services are more available. Integration of a peer-delivered model in the health care system requires the development a set of services that are optimally delivered by peers and a standardized training program that leads to a certification or designation accepted by service provider agencies and payers, and pays a living wage.");

Physician incentives should be applied to encourage physicians to practice in rural and other isolated communities of the state, and should include the removal of existing barriers for the reimbursement of telemedicine services. Culturally sensitive modalities of care should be required when considering the needs of key, high risk populations including MSM, MSM of color, transgender people, women of color, and injection drug users.

Such education deals not just with providing information on disease but tools for living healthily across the lifespan. This is similar to youth nutrition programs not only addressing the dangers of obesity but providing guidance on good food choices and exercise. Sexual health education, including LGBT sexual health, provides students with the knowledge, skills, and support they need to make healthy decisions, develop positive beliefs, and respect the important role sexuality plays throughout a person’s life. At the secondary level, sexuality education includes the knowledge and skills to delay sexual activity and prevent and protect against sexually transmitted infections including HIV, unintended pregnancies, including the effective use condoms, contraceptives, nPEP, and PrEP.

One model, the “HIV Stops with Me” campaign, is a statewide information effort targeting communities of high HIV prevalence to address stigma, discrimination and the prevention benefits of HIV treatment. A campaign that targets both HIV-infected and HIV uninfected individuals should promote prevention interventions and serve to improve treatment adherence for people living with HIV. Lowering the threshold for consent and access to treatment and ARV-P (antiretroviral prophylaxis) for adolescents at risk for HIV acquisition should be explored. Stigma has greatly impacted the ability of many members of affected communities to remain in care.

Data reported from the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) A5001 cohort demonstrate that HIV/HCV co-infected patients visit the emergency department more frequently, are hospitalized more often, and have longer hospital stays than HIV mono-infected patients. Other studies have established HCV-related end-stage liver disease as a leading cause of in-hospital mortality among HIV-infected patients. The reduction and treatment of HCV transmission is a key priority for ensuring one devastating epidemic is not ended while another, which impacts many of the same populations, continues. HCV detection and treatment directly relates to individual health outcomes and overall quality of care. Targeted efforts may potentially eliminate HCV-related morbidity and mortality among co-infected persons by providing HCV testing to all persons living with HIV and restrictions to access based on financial considerations should be addressed and by removing restrictions to HCV treatment access based on financial considerations for individuals coinfected with HCV HIV/HCV.");

The creation of a web-based, public facing ‘Ending the Epidemic Dashboard' is recommended to broadly disseminate information to stakeholders on the Initiative’s progress. This would include reflecting trends and county-level maps of key metrics related to the initiative, and should be updated quarterly. An important step taken in 2014 was a change in state law that allows sharing of surveillance data with medical providers to improve linkage and retention of HIV-infected persons in care. The state should build on existing technologies, and adopt new ones as appropriate to collect, integrate and disseminate priority data that include prevention, quality of care, and social determinants indicators. Key HIV quality metrics need to be adopted in systems which have an impact on provider and plan reimbursement to ensure improved performance is incentivized. To advance this effort a statewide consortia made up of academia, service providers, and other organizations should be considered to design, assess, and evaluate large data sets and to conduct or commission qualitative and quantitative research crucial to measuring the Blueprint success.
