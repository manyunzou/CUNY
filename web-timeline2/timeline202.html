            <p class="billContent">Mandate comprehensive sexual health education in NYS public schools.</p>
            <h4 class="billTitle">Summary</h4>
            <p class="billSum">NYS bill S3737 and the concurrent A768 would add a new section 817 to the NYS Education Law to require the Commissioners of Health, Mental Health and Education to create and establish a comprehensive, medically accurate and age-appropriate sex education curriculum to be taught in grades 1-12 in all public and
charter schools.</p>
            <h4 class="billTitle">Importance for Ending the AIDS Epidemic: </h4>
            <p class="billImportance">The ETE Blueprint supports educating New York State youth in
making healthy, positive choices about sexual health in order to avoid negative health outcomes such as HIV and STIs and unintended pregnancy (BP 23, Promote comprehensive sexual health education). This recommendation supports an expansion of comprehensive, age-appropriate, medically accurate health and sexuality education in 1-12 schools, which in turn would increase the number of young people receiving ageappropriate information about HIV and STI prevention tools, such as condoms, and nPEP and PrEP. This recommendation will also create a foundation of support for HIV testing by providing young people with information and messages that encourage and normalize HIV testing and prevention tools such as condoms, nPEP and PrEP. Mandating a basic curriculum for sexual health education is necessary to ensure that all youth are provided with the same essential public health information. A curriculum developed under the direction of these three State agencies will be inclusive of the full range of health and mental health issues currently affecting our youth, and the use of a uniform curriculum will facilitate implementation across the State.</p>
